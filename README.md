# Fryfire - The Friendly Fire Game Engine

Fryfire is a small game engine which was born during the development of
Friendly Fire, a game written in three days for the Ludum Dare 46 game jam.
It was further enhanced for our Ludum Dare 47 game Hyperloop and was then
extracted into a separate project to be used in future game jam projects and
hopefully it will be of some use for other game projects.

Fryfire is written in TypeScript and therefor targets game development for
the Web or Electron.
